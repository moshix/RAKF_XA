# RAKF_XA
This is the same old RAKF system (made by ESG Systems Inc) but adapted back to MVS/SP and MVS/XA.

The original RAKF was backported from ESG to MVS 3.8 which uses a different wayt to verify access than later versions of MVS. Also, several bugs were fixed. 

This RAKF applies cleanly to MVS/SP 1.3.5 and MVS/XA
