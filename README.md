# RAKF_XA
This is the same old RAKF system (made by ESG Systems Inc) that is used in MVS 3.8 TK4, but adapted back again to MVS/SP and MVS/XA.

The original RAKF was backported from ESG to MVS 3.8 which uses a different way to verify access than later versions of MVS. Also, several bugs were fixed. 

This RAKF applies cleanly to MVS/SP 1.3.5 and MVS/XA, for those who still run these slightly older z/OS versions.
